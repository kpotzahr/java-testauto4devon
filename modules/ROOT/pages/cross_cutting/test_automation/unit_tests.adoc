== Unit- and Unit-Integration-Tests

* AAA pattern

* High coverage != good tests, but low coverage = missing tests

* Use TDD to improve code and test quality

* Prefer delegation over inheritance for cross-cutting testing functionality. Good places to put this kind of code can be realized and reused via the JUnit @Rule mechanism.

* Tool-Stack: Junit 5, assertJ, Mockito

* Use AssertJ to write good readable and maintainable tests that also provide valuable feedback in case a test fails. Do not use legacy JUnit methods like assertEquals anymore!
